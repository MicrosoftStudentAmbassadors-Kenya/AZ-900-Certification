Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is Microsoft's cloud-based IAM service that allows for your organization members to sign in and access your Azure Cloud resources securely.

Here are the basic terms to get started within this article:

â€‹Azure Role-Based Access - This is a service that provides controlled access to your resources.
Active Directory (Windows Active Directory) - Is an Identity and access management (IAM) service that runs on the windows server, on-premises, and is managed by your organization.
IAM(Identity and Access Management) - Are techniques and policies that Azure uses to protect access to cloud resources
E.g Azure Role-Based Access
Azure AD Connect - Synchronizes user identities on-premise AD to Azure AD
Authentication - This is the process of establishing the identity of a person or service. that wants to access a resource.
Authorization - Establishes the level of access an authenticated person has.
Tenant - Represents an organization.
Scope - Is a set of resources E.g management group.
In order to access resources in an organization, the user is first authenticated before being authorized

Who Uses Azure AD?
IT administrators can use it to control access to their app and cloud resources.
App Developers can use it to add Single Sign-On to their app.
Online Service Subscribers tenants using Microsoft 365 and Azure are already using Azure AD
Services Provided By Azure AD
Single-Sign On
SSO enables a user to sign in using one username and one password only once to access multiple applications.
In order to allow for a synchronized sign-in both on-premises and on the cloud the AAD Connect is used.
Multi-factor Authentication
This is where the user is prompted to enter an additional form of identification E.g A fingerprint scan. Multi-Factor Authentication elements are;
Something the user knows
Email and password

Something the user has
A code sent to the user's phone

Something the user is
Fingerprint scan

MFA prevents attacks from people with stolen passwords.

Conditional Access
This is an AAD tool that is used to allow or deny access to resources based on identity signals. The signals include;
Who the user is

Where the user is

The device the user is requesting from

Conditional Access is used when you want to:

Require MFA to access an app.
Require access to services only through approved client apps.
Block access from untrusted sources.
Role-Based Access

It is applied to a scope and we have 3 roles:

Owner

Reader

Contributor

When to use RBAC:

To allow one user to manage VMs and another to manage virtual networks
To allow an app to access all resources in a resource group
